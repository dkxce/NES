LIVES!
Codes 1 to 5 let you adjust lives. Code 4 is really good for 
handicapping one player.

2	IATOZA	Start players 1 & 2 with 6 lives
3	AATOZE	Start players 1 & 2 with 9 lives
4	VATOLE	Start player 1 with 8 lives and player 2 with 3

5	SXIOPO	Infinite lives for both players
JUMPS!
Super and Mega-jumps can be achieved while standing still, running 
or turbo running (holding down button B). Try entering Codes 6, 7 and 
8 or Codes 9, 10 and 11 for all-around Super- or Mega-jumping.
Super jumps let you jump better--the effect is especially noticeable 
when turbo running. 
6	APZLGK	Super jump from a standing start only
7	TPZLTG	Super jump from running only
8	GPZUAG	Super jump from turbo running only
Mega-jumps enable you to jump almost to the top of the screen--
right off the top when 
turbo running! 
9	APZLGG	Mega-jump from a standing start only
10	APZLTG	Mega-jump from running only
11	GAZUAG	Mega-jump from turbo running only
MOON GRAVITY!
Moon gravity is a brilliant ability! It has weird and wonderful 
effects. Again, it works when stationary, running, or turbo running. 
The Moon gravity effect is more fun than Super- or Mega-jumps, but 
it is harder to get used to. Stay with it and you'll find that it gives 
the game an added twist!
You can control the height of your Moon jumps. To jump really high, 
tap button A really quickly. To do low jumps hold down button A for 
about one second.
Use this power to find new places to explore. You can even jump over 
the flags! (If you're playing to complete the game rather than just 
explore it, don't jump over the flagpoles--or else you'll get "stuck" 
and have to reset.)
12	YAZULG	Moon Gravity from a standing start
13	YAZUIG	Moon Gravity from a running start
14	YAZUYG	Moon Gravity from turbo running only
